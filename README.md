## About

This library provides [Hamcrest](https://hamcrest.org) matchers that return
[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) `Constraint` instances, allowing the matchers to
be used anywhere a PHPUnit constraint is allowed.

This is not an official Hamcrest project and has no affiliation with
[hamcrest.org](https://hamcrest.org). The *matchers* this library provides are
not true Hamcrest matchers in that they do not return Hamcrest `Matcher` instances,
as [defined by the Hamcrest project](https://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/tutorial#writing-custom-matchers).
Instead, the functions in this library return `Constraint` instances, for use
with PHPUnit.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating
in this project and its community, you are expected to uphold this code.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the **official** PHP port of Hamcrest Matchers:
> [hamcrest/hamcrest-php](https://packagist.org/packages/hamcrest/hamcrest-php)!

## Installation

Install this package as a development dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require --dev rest-certain/hamcrest-phpunit
```

## Usage

This library provides all Hamcrest matchers as static methods on the
`RestCertain\Hamcrest\Matchers` class and also as functions in the
`RestCertain\Hamcrest` namespace. These methods and functions may be used within
the context of PHPUnit tests.

``` php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

use function RestCertain\Hamcrest\assertThat;
use function RestCertain\Hamcrest\both;
use function RestCertain\Hamcrest\containsStringIgnoringCase;
use function RestCertain\Hamcrest\isA;
use function RestCertain\Hamcrest\startsWithIgnoringCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testExample(): void
    {
        assertThat(
            'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog',
            both(isA('string'))
                ->and(startsWithIgnoringCase('the'))
                ->and(containsStringIgnoringCase('FOX')),
        );
    }
}
```
